/**
 * Custom event tracking for Vercel Web Analytics.
 *
 * Everything funnels through this module rather than calling `track()` inline
 * so the event names stay a closed set. Vercel's dashboard groups by exact
 * string, so a stray "Lead Submit" alongside "Lead Submitted" silently splits
 * one funnel into two and neither number is right.
 *
 * Every page here is prerendered, so these run during SSR too — `track()` is a
 * no-op without a browser, but the guard keeps that explicit rather than
 * relying on the library's internals.
 *
 * Properties must stay flat: Vercel accepts string, number, boolean, and null
 * only, and silently drops nested objects.
